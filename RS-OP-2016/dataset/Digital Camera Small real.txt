I was a little concerned about the mixed reviews but I thought I would take a chance. I have and love my Canon G10 but did not want to carry it everywhere with me.  I needed a little camera to carry with me and not worry about. I purchased my Powershot A2200 for 129. and could not complain about that. I liked how you can move through the different modes quickly and I especially liked the live mode. I am an artist and it is very important for me to control color and contrast and I can easily do that in the live mode. I understand the problems some of the other reviews complained about especially the blurriness. I too had blurry photos when I first started using it. This camera has a learning curve - it is a very sensitive camera and you have to become familiar with it and choose the mode ( program, live , auto ) that is best for you. Also there are several options to control in the focus of the camera. I suggest you become familiar with it to improve your results.  This is a good camera for someone like myself that is familiar with using cameras and want options for controlling images.  If you just want to point and shoot and not think about it - this may not be the best choice. I am really impressed with the photos I have taken. I mainly use the live mode - it is a very flexible mode - shooting well in low museum light and even out of a fast moving car.  Given what I received for this cost I am very pleased. I love my little light canon camera.;;4.0;;April 29, 2011;;74;;76;;0.973684

Very nice image quality at ISO 80 in P mode where you have some control over the image. Although their is no image stabilization unless you switch to scene mode and then it's called 'Blur Reduction' ...new one on me...and no choice of ISO other than AUTO. Also it shoots at a reduced resolution. I guess you can't have it all at this price. Just make sure you have your mini tripod ready for those important shots unless your in scene mode and choosing 'Blur Reduction';;4.0;;June 11, 2011;;4;;5;;0.8

Although the camera has numerous features that are attractive there are two issues that detract, Lag time and battery life.  When the battery is freshly charged the lag time is comparable to the SD line of cameras.  After ten to 15 shots the lag time gradually gets too long. I would not recommend using it for shooting pictures at an event, it ma be okay for still lief pictures.  The battery is a lithium-ion, same as the SD series.  However, it is rated at only 740 mAh compared to 940 mAh on the SD series.  On a recent trip the battery died after seven hours of usage.  Today the battery monitor said I had used 1/3 of the capacity in 2.5 hours.  I recommend spending the extra money on the SD series or buying a different brand.;;2.0;;April 25, 2011;;45;;54;;0.833333

It's been a week now and after about 150 pictures, it's going back tomorrow.  It's a nice small camera with some cool features, but picture quality is terrible.  My wife's old point and shoot got wet and went to camera heaven while we were on vacation, so I thought this would make a good replacement.  It was a little more than I spent on the previous camera, but Cannon has made a good name for itself and I figured it was a safe bet.  Well, I figured wrong.  Maybe one out of 10 or 15 pictures comes out decent in good conditions.  In all but bright light, it is nearly impossible to hand hold the camera and get a sharp shot.  The auto white balance is often wrong.  In bright light I get a haze over the pictures (lens flare?).  In low light I get reflections of what looks like dirt on the lens even after I have carefully cleaned the lens with a lens cloth.  Out of 150 or so pictures, I have maybe 10 decent ones and none that are any better than just decent.  Our previous point and shoot took such good pictures that I started to neglect the SLR.  This camera takes only slightly better pictures than my daughter's $20 digital camera.  With all of the good reviews I have read about this camera, maybe mine was a lemon, but I'll be gun shy when it comes to cannon in the future though.;;1.0;;September 8, 2011;;9;;10;;0.9

I did that but within a couple of shots I found the settings to be overly bright & very noisy as it looks like the ISO had been cranked up to 1600 (which is ridiculous for any compact) for a not so dark room. Its best to switch straight to Program mode and get accustomed with the manual controls. Thankfully Canon has realised that some people don't know anything about cameras and has provided an inbuilt help system (which can be turned on/off) to set examples of what each thing does, this can save a lot of time & avoid reading through the 200 page PDF manual! Very handy for those who are just about to leave on vacation<br /><br />The discreet mode is great for those that need to take a photo but don't want to attract any attention. This mode will not use flash & will not make any sound at all aside from a tiny mechanical movement. Unfortunately the LCD screen will still continue to emit light since there is no manual viewfinder to look through. The colour reproduction is actually pretty accurate, its possible to replicate what you see with your own eyes (something that's usually impossible whilst indoors with compacts). The optical zoom mode is nice, you get a choice of both 4x optical & digital zoom of up to 16x. If you want to preserve your photos I strongly suggest turning digital mode off. Thankfully its quite obvious where the digital zoom will come into play as it'll pause for a second before continuing & you'll notice a line inbetween the zoom bar. The LCD screen itself is nice & large & easy to view under direct sunlight - a problem that arises even amongst DSLR users!<br /><br />Now for the bad points, the lack of IS (image stabilisation) is disappointing as a lot of images in low-lit rooms will get blurry even if your hands seem like they're barely moving. The all plastic casing is also worrying, I'm pretty sure that the tripod holder isn't even metal which means it could wear down quickly & wobble around. The delay between shots is very slow taking about 4 seconds to get from one to the next. The plastic cover that covers the USB transfer cord is also disappointing as not only is it hard to get open but feels like it'll eventually be ripped off accidentally. Although this camera seems to take good photos via manual controls you'll instantly notice upon zooming in that it'll still have digital noise including the flash shots so detail will be lost during editing even if you're only shooting in 2MP (less than 20% of its full resolution). Camera distortion is another issue with that rounded affect on straight objects at angles and a lot of the features are gimmicky and aren't helpful for anyone who's serious about photography. <br /><br />However I'm probably being a bit too harsh since coming from a DSLR. It is an all round good budget $100 camera & you'll no longer have to worry about using flash for dark indoor shots which usually kills the photo with false lighting. Just be warned that digital noise will popup on occasions & a few shots will get pretty blurry without image stabilisation, if this worries you, aim for something a bit better.;;4.0;;September 7, 2011;;7;;7;;1.0

You'll have to pay them $180 to install it.<br /><br />I was considering buying this camera until I read the manual, which states you must replace the waterproof seals every year.  After numerous phone calls to Panasonic's customer service in Kingston, Jamaica and Manila, Phillipines over overly compressed garbled phone links, speaking to utterly ignorant CSRs, I was directed to Panasonic's service center in Texas, where I spoke to an ignorant CSR who told me it would cost $180 to replace the seals because that is what every repair costs.  After asking her again about a dozen times for about 20 minutes, she went to check with someone and determined that replacing those seals allegedly costs $45 + parts + shipping.  After even more asking again and again, she was not able to come up with the cost of the part.  However, shipping runs $12 to $30.  If you're lucky, maybe it will only be $12, but don't bet on it.  And shipping it to them is your problem.  No way to know how much they will gouge you on the part.  I wouldn't expect it to be cheap, though.<br /><br />If you buy this item you should assume that you can only use it in water for 1 year, or else assume it will cost you at least $60/year for the pleasure of owning a waterproof camera.<br /><br />(I note that Sony also states you must replace the seals every year on their tx10 "waterproof" camera.  I haven't tried to find out what they charge for the seals, because Sony says right in their manual that the camera's touch screen does not work in the presence of water.);;1.0;;October 14, 2011;;19;;23;;0.826087

I purchased this camera because I did not want to expose my pro Nikon to the elements, and this camera is wonderful for that purpose.<br /><br />I have added some sample shots for you to judge the quality for yourself.  I have to agree with other reviews that the GPS function is ok at best.  I have found that I need to be in clear view of the sky for the GPS to find the current location.  I have noticed that while the GPS is searching, it really uses lots of battery power.  I now geotag a few photos and then turn off the GPS to save on battery power.<br /><br />In strong light, the camera sensor washes out some images...  I would like to see a feature to allow for strong backlight as well.  <br /><br />It is very easy to put your finger in front of the lens by mistake.  <br /><br />If you use a Mac, the AVCHD (30 min recording at a time) mode does not play, I have to A) convert the file or B) set the camera to HD (10 min recording at a time) mode.<br /><br />I have dropped the camera from 5 feet or so into the sand where it was 75% buried, I found that I needed to rinse the camera off under running water to get all the sand out before I opened the door.  No damage or issues with this.<br /><br />I have operated the camera in 20 degree weather for hours with no issues.<br /><br />I have operated the camera in 90 degree weather for hours with no issues.<br /><br />I love that I can simply push a button to start and stop the recording process.<br /><br />If you have some basic knowledge of photography, you will be able to use all of the different available settings to your benefit.  If you simply want to point and shoot, keep the camera in the iA mode and this will work out fine for you.<br /><br />I really like the night shot mode because it allows me to hand hold the camera.<br /><br />Overall, I really think that this camera is a very good buy, given all that it can stand and the places I can take it without having to worry about it.  No the photos quality is not A+,  but I am also not exposing a camera that costs thousands of dollars to the elements.  I have in fact recommended this camera to other friends.  I am enjoying this camera and I think you may enjoy it as well...;;4.0;;April 12, 2011;;112;;114;;0.982456

(sample underwater video);;I've added a video of some underwater & action videos I've taken with the Lumix - check it out! These videos play full screen on my 24" monitor with great clarity - they are of course reduced definition for the web.<br /><br />We were going on a cruise to the caribbean last spring and I wanted a camera I could take with me snorkeling. Beyond that though, I wanted a camera I didn't have to WORRY about constantly.  I own a Canon EOS Rebel T2i 18 MP CMOS APS-C Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD (Body Only) and a Canon PowerShot SD1400IS 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Pink), both of which I love, but the DSLR is just too bulky and too expensive to take to the beach or on a boat, and even taking the small SD1400IS would mean constant vigilance to make sure it didn't get wrecked.  After seeing someone at a waterpark using a waterproof camera, I knew I wanted one for our cruise.<br /><br />I wanted a waterproof camera, but I did not want to sacrifice picture quality to get it. The quality didn't need to be perfect, but what was the point if the pictures came out crappy? I bought 3 cameras to compare them: This one obviously, the Pentax Optio WG-1 Adventure Series 14 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 5x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom (Black) and the Olympus Stylus Tough 6020 14MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD (Green).  I took some pictures and videos with each.  I didn't attempt to submerge them as I was planning to return the two I didn't like).<br /><br />I found that the Lumix took the best pictures and video of the three. I was really disappointed by the quality of the images that came from the other two.  They really just weren't up to par - many came out unfocused and the video was low quality. The Panasonic if I remember correctly had a seriously horrible lag time when taking pictures as well. The Lumix was however the biggest one of the bunch, its just a bit bigger than most digital cameras now a days, but not terribly so.  The Pentax had a great strap at the end and a clip, which I liked a lot, but I just wasn't willing to sacrifice picture quality for form factor.  The Pentax also had some kind of macro mode, which I honestly couldn't figure out what on earth I would use it for.<br /><br />Another thing I liked about the Lumix was the way they seal the camera - there is a door on the side which opens and has a switch to lock that conceals everything - the sdcard, the battery and the usb connection.  The other cameras had multiple openings for these things and relied on little rubber things to keep the water out.  So I chose the lumix and I have not regretted it!<br /><br />So far this camera has been snorkeling (and I dive down 15 feet while snorkeling), its been to the beach many times, and its been to water parks where we took it down the slides and took videos of ourselves in the wave pool. I love that I can leave it around my wrist or in my pocket and not have to worry about my camera being left by the towels in a public place - or not get any pictures at all.<br /><br />I have had no problem with the camera at all, and the pictures it takes are fabulous. Using a waterproof camera IS a bit more work though.  You cannot simply hop out of the water pop it open and throw in another battery.  I don't open the camera until its been allowed to air dry for a few hours after being toweled dry.  I follow the directions and carefully check the seal on the camera and use the provided brush to remove any sand or debris from the seal area. When snorkeling I put the cameras leash tightly around my wrist and do not take it off.  You also have to be careful about the temperature of the camera - if you leave it out in the hot sun, then plunge into the pool with it - the inside of the lens will fog up, this is not a problem with the camera, if you leave it somewhere to dry out it works fine again.  The manual warns against this problem - its not something they can prevent, its chemistry.  Try to keep the camera from getting too hot, don't leave it in direct sunlight.  Also, when you are using the camera in and out of the water the lens will have water droplets on it, which can obscure your picture.  It can be annoying to get them off especially if you are completely wet yourself.  I've taken to blowing hard on it, though sometimes that can fog it up temporarily.  I'm considering seeing if a big of shammy attached to the strap might be a useful tool for this problem.<br /><br />Another thing to beware is since this camera is more rugged you start treating it more ruggedly - and leaving it around the cement pool deck to get kicked around will result in scratches to the LCD screen, etc - I invested in a screen protector.  I also bought a float strap Olympus STRAP FLOAT ORANGE but DO NOT think you can use this out in open water where the camera cannot be retrieved it if sinks.  The float strap is a great addition if you are using the camera in the pool and the kids want to play with it.  The camera is shock proof but I don't want to test it by dropping it on the bottom of the pool repeatedly.<br /><br />In conclusion - if this camera was just a slight bit smaller, I would make it my everyday regular 'purse' camera, the picture quality is that good.  I love having a camera that I can take with me and not worry about the elements, if its raining or we are at the beach. And this camera has performed well underwater on numerous occasions.  I'm very happy with it!<br />;;5.0;;November 6, 2011;;5;;5;;1.0
